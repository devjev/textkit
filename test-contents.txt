It was about a week later that Edward Mottisfont rang David Blake up on the
telephone and begged him in agitated accents, to come to Mr. Mottisfont without
delay.


“It’s another attack—a very bad one,” said Edward in the hall. His voice shook a
little, and he seemed very nervous. David thought it was certainly a bad attack.
He also thought it a strange one. The old man was in great pain, and very ill.
Elizabeth Chantrey was in the room, but after a glance at his patient, David
sent her away. As she went she made a movement to take up an empty cup which
stood on the small table beside the bed, and old Mr. Edward Mottisfont fairly
snapped at her.


“Leave it, will you—I’ve stopped Edward taking it twice. Leave it, I say!”
